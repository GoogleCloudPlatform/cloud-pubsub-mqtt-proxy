# MQTT Proxy for Cloud Pub/Sub

This project aims to provide a solution for utilizing Cloud Pub/Sub with IoT client devices through an MQTT interface.

MQTT is a lightweight protocol and hence suitable for IoT devices. The source depends on the [Moquette broker] [1] and the [Eclipse Paho MQTT Client library] [2].
